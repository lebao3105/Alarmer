## Alarmer for BlackBerry OS

This is an alarm program made for BlackBerry OS 7 and lower (minium OS not set).

I made this because the stock Clock app's alarm function is too limited.

Thanks [JohnSpahr](https://github.com/JohnSpahr/GymCounter) for the initial look at how to make a BlackBerry app!

## Building

It's years after BBOS being deprecated - removed, redirected etc links, app signing is down...

1. Install JDK 1.6 and BlackBerry's plugin for Eclipse. BlackBerry's own JDE not tested. Add JDK to `%PATH%`.

> You may want to install BlackBerry emulator for quick test.

2. Open the project

3. On Eclipse: Alt+Shift+E, L to install into a device. Or click on Run as usual in other IDEs. (run in emulator)

## Screenshots?
